####CODEBOOK******
This codebook describes the variables found in the tidy dataset generated by running run_analysis.R.

###Description:
The original data set was obtained from 
[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones]


It is described as a "Human Activity Recognition database built from the 
recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living 
while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
The experiments involved 30 subjects. Each subject performed six 
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
 with a sensor-equipped smartphone attached to their waist. 
The smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope we used to capture 3-axial 
linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

###Information about features involved (taken from "feature-info.txt"):
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity
 were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 


Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing
 --fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 


These signals were used to estimate variables of the 
feature vector for each pattern:  

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.



###Major-features:	
tBodyAcc-XYZ  
tGravityAcc-XYZ  
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
tBodyGyro-XYZ 
 
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  
tBodyAccMag  
tGravityAccMag  
tBodyAccJerkMag  
tBodyGyroMag  
tBodyGyroJerkMag 
 
fBodyAcc-XYZ  
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
fBodyGyro-XYZ  
fBodyAccMag  
fBodyAccJerkMag  
fBodyGyroMag  
fBodyGyroJerkMag



The mean value and std deviation were estimated from these signals and these are
 what we are interested in for our tidy dataset.

###Resultant Tidy Dataset:


Each record in the original data set contained a 561 dimensional feature 
vector with time and frequency domain variables, as well as the subject's id, activity number,
 and a label indicated the activity they performed. I have extracted the variables 
containing the estimated mean and std deviation of the signals - giving a 66 dimensional feature vector 
(plus subject id and activity label).


As mentioned, there are 30 subjects and 6 activities. To create the tidy data set, 
I have averaged those mean and standard deviation measurements over subjects and activities. 
Thus, the tidy dataset has 180 records (30 subjects * 6 activities).




Following are the variables in the final tidy data set( and their hold on to the average of these features 
for each activity and for each individual):
